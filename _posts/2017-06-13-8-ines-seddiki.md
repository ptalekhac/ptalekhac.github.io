# Leadership for outsiders, by outsiders.
 
 
When she doesn’t work as a CSR project manager at AXA, Ines is consistently finding creative ways to share her self-confidence and open-mindedness to the young _banlieusard.e.s_, the outsiders from the French urban projects. In 2015, when she worked in New York City as consultant, she got deeply inspired by how youth from Harlem and the Queens were empowered: workshops, lectures and debates training. Looking back to her childhood time in the Paris region inner cities (Stains, Saint-Denis and Sarcelles), Ines realized that social working in the underprivileged urban areas, only based on academic tutoring and cultural visits, was insufficient to prevent their youth from wasting their hidden talents.

Deeply convinced by the great leadership potential of the French projects, Ines decided to replicate the _“For Us By Us”_ spirit she saw in the US ghettos to bring perspectives and self-confidence to the suburban youth. She understands that diffusing this empowerment movement will require a community, where inspirations, tips and knowledge are constantly shared. Once she got back to France in 2015, Ines decided to create her own association, __[GHETT'UP](http://ghettup.strikingly.com/)__, whose goal is to open up and empower the young _banlieusard.e.s_ and make them realize their full potential. To achieve this goal, she understands that she not only has to bring inspiration, but also a structure their network and share knowledge. With her crew, she has been designing and implementing various leadership programs and networking events: inspirational talks and cultural content, debates, public speaking workshops, Skype calls between middle schools students from the French and American inner cities etc.

I am truly impressed by her energy and humility. Few weeks ago, she didn’t hesitate to take the her voice to shake up the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron at his public discussion with “diversity’s young leaders” in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of the poorest French urban areas. When most of the speakers were brown-nosing Macron, she explicitly told him that she did not buy his demagogic talks to the poor suburbian voters, and warned him if his promises weren’t followed by concrete measures in the projects. Macron’s team was inevitably furious against her, but her incisive open mic attracted the attention to French Television Show _Quotidien_ who interviewed her, putting GHETT'UP at the national level exposure.

Following her unpurposed media hack, Ines decided to write a __[column](https://www.streetpress.com/sujet/1492790382-macron-voie-quartiers-blague)__ in which she is denouncing the lack of leadership in the poor suburbs, which enables persons like Macron to be “a hope” when he has nothing to do with the most underprivileged areas. To her, this lack of leadership, self-confidence and critical thinking is also one of the main reasons why fake suburban iconic figures, such as polemists Alain Soral and Dieudonné, took over underprivileged naïve youth minds who would believe in any conspiracy theories. To her, the most underprivileged suburbs have to create, cultivate and curate their own leaders, a new generation of iconic personalities who will be able to break social ice ceilings in entrepreneurship, business, politics, arts, activism, and become role models who will inspire the youth.

As long as the GHETT'UP community is getting bigger and bigger, Ines is already identified as one the most influential leaders in the Parisian Banlieues. The New York Times interviewed her on __[their article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/world/europe/france-marine-lepen-emmanuel-macron.html?r=0)__ covering the French poor suburbs’ perception of the presidential election. I would not be surprised if she will engage herself in politics, and I truly think she will be an amazing member of parliament.
