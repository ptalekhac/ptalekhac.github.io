Tell me who is inspiring you
And I’ll tell you who you are
Design your motivational crew  
Where everyone is a shining star 

Inspiration cannot be quantified
So take all the energy you can find 
Inside your surrounding leaders 
Who share our causes, and fuck the haters. 

We dare being bold, outstanding the crowd,
But truth be told, we can’t escape from doubts,
It’s alright, we are working on our own ego, 
Contradictions and vulnerability, so let it go. 

This is an ode to my great people
Who are kicking determinism, 
At any stage, no matter the level,
Humankind is about that, isn’t it?
