# Producing endorphins anywhere, anytime, anyway.

 
_“You have no future !”_ those were the words of the principal of lycée Voltaire, a eastern-Parisian high school, to my friend Nelson. This was in 2008. After failing to pass the French baccalaureate exam, Nelson got kicked out from my Parisian high school Lavoisier, changing academic institutions for the third or fourth times. Nelson and I were in the same class in Terminale, the French equivalent of US 12th grade). As far as I remember, Nelson wasn’t really focused in any courses, except in sports where he was acing all the tracks. His sister and brother respectively played Basketball at the federal level, US college or even professional level.

After a depressing meeting with an orientation counsellor, Nelson realized that indeed, he didn’t have any future in the French educational system, or at least for the moment. Then he randomly read a brochure from the UQAM (Université du Quebec à Montréal). He didn’t hesitate longer: he quickly decided to move to the French Canada to study a bachelor political science and international relations. Unlike in high school, he chose to study hard and get involved on the campus life and become a student ambassador in the international relation services department, promoting UQAM all around the world and helping his fellow students to prepare their exchange academic programs, especially the one who are applying for scholarship. When he got the opportunity himself to study abroad, he decided to go where nobody expects him to be: Seoul, South Korea.

New city, new continent, new culture, and where excessiveness is the norm. This was in 2012, with the whole __[Gangnam style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0)__ ’s global hysteria.  At this time I was actually working in the Gangnam area, in consulting and development missions for a French investment and consulting firm. So we reconnected in Seoul and chilled out several times. One night, we went to a Hip-Hop Club in Seoul, NB2, and I experienced a very embarrassing, not to say fcuked up, moment. When Nelson was dancing with a Korean girl, most of the surrounding Korean guys were laughing and taking pictures with their smartphone like they were in a zoo. I felt a bit disgusted, and then I remembered that racism is still very common in East-Asia.

On his side, Nelson didn’t bother that much. He realized his position of being a black person in a “new-rich” country like Korea, where a growing upper-middle-class has been traveling abroad for only few years, exposes him in these kind of embarrassing moments. He kept learning Korean, winning in all the sports competition (handball, table tennis, basketball dunk contest…).

He even created his own student crew, International Love, to promote peace during the geopolitical tensions with North Korea. With his crew and talented film-maker __[Jeremy Rubier](https://vimeo.com/jeremyrubier)__, he co-directed a HQ video __*[Nelson dances against the war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6cVXLEpRPQ)*__ that pays tribute to the city of Seoul. The video had a little buzz, and even got awarded “video of the week” by GQ Magazine.

The concept works so well that Nelson convinced the Mama Shelter - the fancy French Hotel-Restaurant group he used to work as a waiter every summer - to produce the video brand content for their venues in __ [Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxHuOtijGgk)__, __[Lyon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp2QUte0hKk)__, __ [Marseille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezCwkIhDLtM)__ and __[Bordeaux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xcmf3Dc08k)__. Everywhere Nelson goes, he shines and attracts positive vibes around him. To me, his main strength remains his ability to both respect the local cultures and got his own entire singularity accepted, without any compromises.

In 2014, after three years of preparation, he achieved one his biggest goals: he got accepted into a Master’s of Public Affairs at the very elitist school Sciences Po. I’m not his father, but knowing from where the started, I was really proud of him. A lot of people who knew him in middle or high school couldn’t believe this news. In his cover letter for Sciences Po, he asserted he wanted to become a French diplomat in East-Asia. Apparently at his graduation last year, the project shifted. Nelson finally decided to engage himself into __[Teach For France](http://www.teachforfrance.org/)__, the two-year program in which some fresh elite schools graduates teach in from the most underprivileged areas’ middle and/or high schools. Today, he is currently teaching English courses to middle school students in Seine-Saint-Denis (93).

Again, Nelson seems to make another _cross-over_ to people. But in fact, knowing that he grew up at Porte de Bagnolet, a popular urban areas in the eastside of Paris, his choice is not that surprising. At each stage of his personal course (UQAM, Korea, Sciences Po, Teach For France), Nelson has always managed to share his positive mindset, his tolerance for cultural difference and various non-merchand interpersonal flows (knowledge, trust, emotions).

For the priority middle school students he’s currently working for, Nelson’s international vision and unconventional journey between three continents, four academic institutions and various creative projects, is actually an huge source of inspirations and perspectives. In today’s world, the English language remains a passport for new opportunities, and in terms of self-learning, an access to culture and education.

From what I heard, Nelson became one the middle school’s favorite teachers, one of his colleagues complained his students were doing his English exercices during their courses. Recently, he brought the kids to a job forum to aware them of what they could do in few years. I found this deliciously ironic for someone who was told that he got no future. I don’t know what he will be doing after “Teach for France”, neither, how, why, with who etc. But I’m sure this is gonna a place where he will be able to shine, dance and spread love.
