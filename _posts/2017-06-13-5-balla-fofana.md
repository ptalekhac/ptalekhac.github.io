# Editing postcolonial perspectives to the French media. 
 
The first time I saw Balla, he was on a TV show. The show was called [Bondy Blog Café](http://www.lcp.fr/emissions/bondy-blog-cafe), a political show on the LCP (the French Parliamentary Channel) that covers a 1-hour debate between a French political or researcher guest and three journalism’ students from the French urban projects a.k.a the *Banlieues*, the majority of these youth were from the French postcolonial African immigration. The concept of the show was interesting, because the two parts represent two separate social bubbles that usually never meet and discuss. But the problem was the format. During the whole hour, the producers were trying to include five or six different topics related to the French underprivileged urban projects (employment, education, culture, security, citizenship, religion…), so most of the debates remained superficial. The most frustrating point was that with such discussion flow, the time allocation was too much in the guest’ favor. Even though, amongst the young journalists, Balla was outstanding with his relevance, patience and analyses.

Few months ago, Balla wrote some deep relevant articles about racism between minorities in France. One was on [the harsh relationships between the Arabic and Black communities in the French *banlieues*](http://www.bondyblog.fr/201504270001/racisme-ordinaire/#.WT_7lBOGMWo), with a relevant point of the forteen centuries slavery heritage between the in Africa. The other one was denouncing [the treatment of the Asian communities in the antiracist media CLIQUE](http://www.liberation.fr/france/2016/12/22/monsieur-achour-le-racisme-n-est-pas-un-jeu-mais-un-enjeu_1536918). I was striken by his intellectual content production’s relevance. The more I read his brilliant articles, the more I started realizing that he is certainly one the brightest influencers to follow when it comes to breakdown French postcolonial issues (structured racial and social discrimination, urban projects policies, police brutality, French neocolonialism in Africa….).

Why ? Because his personal journey is incredible. He grew up with an analphabetic mother who wasn’t able to practice the French language, and today he works as a full-time journalist for the national newspaper [Libération](http://www.liberation.fr/auteur/16109-balla-fofana). He writes about society, politics, culture and education. He started professionalizing on journalism with the Bondy Blog, the media dedicated to the banlieues created right after the French urban riots in 2005. Bondy Blog’s mission was to bring more accurate views of the urban projects than what is produced by the dominant mainstream media, and train a new generation of journalists who could bring different perspectives  to these media.

After Bondy Blog, Balla worked for almost two years as a reporter at TF1, the biggest private TV Channel in France. He was an on-field reporter for the “Journal de 13h”, one of the most popular TV news shows presented by the right-wing journalist Jean-Pierre Pernaud. Behind the scene, Balla was able to observe and analyze how the production’s pyramidal organization was filtering information to comply with the channel’s business obligations with advertisers. Thanks to his transclass background, his vision of today’s French media ecosystem/background is probably one of the most relevant and complete ones.

What is truly remarkable with Balla is that even if he is building a brilliant career in journalism, he remains obsessed of not losing grounds with where he is from. While he’s gradually elevating himself, he is supporting many local initiatives for the youth from the suburbs, especially in media education. Balla regularly brings middle school banlieusard.e.s to meet with the TF1 and Libération editors’ committees. In these meetings, the kids are challenging a lot the white Parisian journalists who are shaken from their social bubbles and intellectual confort zones.

I recently asked Balla if he had some political ambitions. He honestly told me that he is seriously considering this, but he has the wisdom and patience to prepare himself carefully. When he will be ready to go to the electoral arena, I would definitely stand by him. As a campaign staff member or simple donator, I don’t care, but I strongly believe in him to become one of our political leaders. This is not about having our French “Barack Obama”, but simply bringing an important signal to world that French society is definitely ready to embrace a postcolonial vision.
