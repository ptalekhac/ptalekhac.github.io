# Let’s straight like democracy.
 
 
Leonor is the co-founder and CEO of __[Voxe.org](http://voxe.org)__, a French-born civic-tech startup that aims at changing democracy and citizenship’s user experience, with an online political program comparison tool as a brand new initial product. The very first time we met, this was at the Officaire coworking space in fall of 2014. We were both struggling in our respective entrepreneurial projects. At that time, she was alone on board - her three other cofounders were working full-time for other ventures - but I was already astonished by her energy, resilience and strong leadership.

One year later, with the little army she recruited, she was leading the Parisian edition of the Google Impact Challenge campaign, an online public vote contest between ten French non-profit organizations. With a 500K € money prize, she was playing her baby project’s financial survivance. During this very demanding 30-day campaign on September, Officaire was overwhelmed by the Challenge, and the way she was managing the campaign was impressive. Voxe.org finally didn’t win the first prize, but as runner-up the civic tech earned 200K. While other runner-ups were publicly showing their disappointment, Leo decides to maintain her tribe’s dynamics by communicating Voxe’s result into a strong milestone. At this time, I was definitely convinced that she could be a very good general during war time.

In the Parisian Civic-Tech scene, Voxe.org is a kind of bulldozer that “puts emotions with substance”. They are not afraid to go on the field as online democracy evangelists, launch new community building projects and events, such as the #VoxeTour all around France.  It’s been almost a year the Voxe.org crew left the Officaire coworking for a bigger office (Paris Pionnières and then Schoolab), but from where I am, I can imagine Leo’s validation with an energic “let’s go!” or conversely a stopping her project leader with a harsh “naah, this is crap”. That’s what I truly like in Leo’s personality: she has a very straight forward mindset. That could be rude for some, but in terms of quick decision-making, this turns out to be useful. When she wants something, she will do everything to get it. And most of the time she manages to get it. Sometimes, she could be a little agressive, but that’s how she is : a fearless, pragmatic and execution-focused fast-learner. Over the last two years, her experience-curve is impressive.

Before Voxe.org, Leo used to work at the United Nations HQ in New-York City and at the big French Multinational Corporation Saint-Goblin in Madrid where she had the frustrating role of “young intrapreneur”. When I saw the amount of energy she’s deploying today, I can imagine how these big hierarchical and bureaucratic organizations could suffocate her. If this was the case, she put up with this and wait for their time to take over full-leadership. Even in some more vulnerable moments, when she was raising doubts on her capacity to maintain Voxe.org during the Google Impact Challenge campaign, she was still showing a lot of dignity and confidence. And another noticeable point, behind a very strong focus on her project, she was one of the most reliable persons who really cares about the co-working space community. Advices, contact introductions, meeting organisation… Always in a very “straight-to-the-point” mode.

In a recent TV interview, the journalist asked “What’s modernity for you?”, she brilliantly answered  “If you put words or conceptualize the modern world, this disappears. Modern world is tomorrow.” Fearless, pragmatic and execution-focused fast-learner.
