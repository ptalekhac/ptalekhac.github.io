#Designing the French-Vietnamese taste to your mouth.


I recently took two friends of mine for diner at __[Banôi](https://www.facebook.com/banoirestaurant/)__, a little Vietnamese restaurant at 129 rue Amelot, near Republique in Paris. It’s a very little restaurant, around 18 square meters, and something like more than 20 people were queuing around. Getting inside the venue was almost impossible, I was merely able to see my friend My-Ly, Banôi’s founder and general manager, a little bit overwhelmed by the customers’ affluence. The day before, she and her restaurant were put on the national spotlight with the French TV cooking show __*[Très Très Bon](https://www.facebook.com/TresTresBon/videos/vb.128123373906610/1495612030491064/?type=2&theater)*__.

Banôi is a very atypical restaurant whose main courses are a variety of springrolls. The concept is simple, each springroll’s receipt is very innovative, and the ingredients are fresh, healthy and affordable. It’s been few weeks the restaurant is always full without spending any euro in communication and advertisement. Different types of Parisian media, such as _My Litte Paris, Bonbon, Les Petites Tables_ or _Paris Première_, were chasing the place. In this tiny place is a hub of good vibes, My Ly has been designing their concept and innovative products.At the end of the day, she’s exhausted but smiling, already preparing the upcoming days’ logistics.

I met My-Ly via __[UJVF](http://www.ujvf.org/)__, my French-Vietnamese cultural association. We attended their one-week easter camp, in which students and young graduates from the association are helping middle and high school kids to prepare their exams. Firstly as a high school student in 2007 and as the cooking staff few years later. When we were in the kitchen cooking food for almost a hundred of people from the easter camp days and nights, My-Ly was already thinking of creating a new concept of Western-Vietnamese cuisine.

She was not a professional chef, but I could see in her eyes a true passion, a burning willingness to undertake and express her bicultural identity. She found in Banôi the best way to educate western people in Paris about her cultural roots. Once you get into Banôi, you feel both in Paris and Saigon at the same time. The little restaurant’s artistic direction is a perfectly suited to the clients, a mix of elderly Vietnamese, Parisian students or young workers. The design and the visual identity are coherent because she’s true to herself and her vision, nurtured by identity personal questions.

While some of our political leaders present “communautarism” as a threat to our French Republic, our association UJVF enables bicultural people like My-Ly and I to share with peers about our hybrid identities. Once we’re able to master our identity schizophrenia, we better know ourselves, and we can cultivate our own cultural singularity and initiate outstanding projects. Within the French-Vietnamese community in Paris, I can think of various personalities that inspire My Ly and I, such as music producer __ [Nodey](https://www.facebook.com/nodeymusic/)__, film-maker __[Francis Cutter](http://www.franciscutter.com/)__ or IT entrepreneur __[Duc Ha Duong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbaNjlQtNr8)__.

When it comes to entrepreneurship, today’s dominant trend is about Sillicon Valley’s “disrupting” tech startups led by some Ivy League’s dropout male geek geniuses who claim to _“make the world a better place”_. My Ly’s is managing to show another narrative I truly value. Daughter of Vietnamese migrants who become Parisian suburbs middle-class, My-Ly graduated from a good French business school before working for three years in marketing and sales for an IT company. In late 2015, with the strong support of her parents and boyfriend, she decided to build her own path. She started with the basics and worked at Sushi Shop, Subway and __[Foyer Vietnam](http://www.foyer-vietnam.org/)__ to understand the business and its daily operations.

Today, she is 26 and she can live from her first life-project that combines two of her passions - cooking and Vietnam - and employ three persons. On August, she will take her first vacations since the beginning of her entrepreneurial journey. This summer break will be an opportunity to step back from the daily operations and think ahead for development strategies. She will also be able to realize what she has already achieved in eighteen months. No matter how far she will go with her entrepreneurial journey, she has already succeeded. She is demonstrating that a simple business that delivers good products, structured by self-discipline and driven by a passionate vision, can work well. And her ability to inspire people locally - especially among the risk-adverse Vietnamese community in the Paris region - is already _“making the world a better place”_.
