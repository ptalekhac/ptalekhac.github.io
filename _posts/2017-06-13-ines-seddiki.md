When she doesn’t work as a CSR project manager at AXA, Ines is consistently finding creative ways to share her self-confidence and open-mindedness to the young banlieusard.e.s, the urban outsiders from the French projects. In 2015, she worked in New York City as consultant, she got deeply inspired by how youth from Harlem and the Queens were empowered, with workshops, lectures and debates training. Looking back to her childhood time in the Paris region inner cities (Stains, Saint-Denis and Sarcelles), Ines realized that social working in the underprivileged urban areas, only based on academic tutoring and cultural visits, was insufficient to prevent their youth from wasting their hidden talents. 

Deeply convinced by the great leadership potential of the French projects, Ines decided to replicate the “For Us By Us” spirit she saw in the US ghettos to bring perspectives and self-confidence to the suburban kids to realize their full potential. She understands that diffusing this leadership culture will require a community, where inspirations, tips and knowledge will be constantly shared. Once she got back to France in 2015, Ines decided to create her own association, Ghett’Up, whose goal is to open up and empower the young banlieusard.e.s. To achieve this goal, she understands that she has to no only bring inspiration, but also network and knowledge. With her crew, she has been designing and implementing various leadership programs and networking events : inspirational talks and movies, debating and public speaking workshops, skype calls between French and American middle schools students etc.

I am truly impressed by her energy and humility. Few weeks ago, she didn’t hesitate to take the her voice to shake up the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron at his public discussion with “diversity’s young leader” in Saint-Denis. When most of the speakers were brown-nosing the former minister of economy, she explicitly told him that she did not buy his demagogic talks to the poor suburbian voters, and warned him if his promises weren’t followed by concrete measures in the projects. Macron’s team was inevitably furious against her, but her incisive open mic attracted the attention to French Television Show “Quotidien” who interviewed her, putting Ghett’Up at the national level exposure. 

Following her unpurposed media hack, Ines decided to write a column in which she is denouncing the lack of leadership in the poor suburbs, which enables persons like Macron to be “a hope” when he has nothing to do with the most underprivileged areas. To her, this lack of leadership, self-confidence and critical thinking is also one of the main reasons why fake suburban iconic figures, such as polemists Alain Soral and Dieudonné, took over underprivileged naïve youth minds who would believe in any conspiracy theories. To her, the suburbs have to create, cultivate and curate their own leaders, a new generation of iconic personalities who will be able to break social ice ceilings in entrepreneurship, business, politics, arts, activism, and become role models who will inspire the youth. 

As long as the Ghett’up community is getting bigger and bigger, Ines is already identified as one the most influential leaders in the Parisian Banlieues. The New York Times interviewed her on their article covering the French poor suburbs’ perception of the presidential election. I would not be surprised if she will engage herself in politics, and I truly think she will be an amazing member of parliament.
