#Mastering your own narrative to challenge determinism. 


The first time I saw Djigui, this was on the French TV show _Des Paroles & Des Actes_ on January 2015. This was few days after the traumatizing terrorists attacks on Charlie Hebdo’s press media and the Jewish supermarket Hypercacher. As a civil society leader from Grigny - the suburb city 30 km from the center of Paris where the Hyper Cacher terrorist Amedy Coulibaly grew up - he was invited to speak at the debate __"École, laïcité, intégration, et maintenant ?"__ with a variety of politicians, intellectuals and journalists.

Djigui got this opportunity after having directed an activist __[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUueJEnjor8)__ where youth from different underprivileged Parisian suburbs were reacting to the article from the conservative media Le Figaro, asserting that __[youth in Grigny believe in the conspiracy theories](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/01/14/01016-20150114ARTFIG00449--grigny-la-ville-de-coulibaly-la-theorie-du-complot-va-bon-train.php)__. On the national TV debate watched by nearly 3M people, Djigui was not as at ease as these public personalities who regularly talk in the media. Still, he was showing calm and determination to denounce the constant stigmatization _“young black arabic muslim = antiFrench antiRepublican antisemitic delinquent terrorist ”_. With an assertive and coherent message, he managed to bring back dignity to the people he aspires to represent, the people from Grigny, and more largely the underprivileged people from the French urban project.

If Djigui understands the subtleties behind the image and their powerful impact on the collective self-representation of society, this is probably because he has been thinking about these issues as much as he has nurtured his passion for cinema. His childhood was amazed by Bruce Lee and the 70’s Hong Kong movies, but his first tipping point with the Seventh Art came with the movie __*[Yamakasi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA0wW7E-Wok)*__ in 2001. In this action comedy, in which youth from the suburbs are practicing urban parkour and improvised themselves as new urban Robin Hoods, Djigui sees a different representation of what he considered as his “big brothers”.

Ten years later, with the help of the association __[1000 visages](https://www.facebook.com/1000visages/)__ that promotes diversity in the French cinema, Djigui starts acting in various short movies. One day, out of 250 candidates, he successfully manages to get a minor role in Julie Lescaut, one of the most popular French Cop series. Very proud at the beginning, he got quickly disillusioned when he realized the producers asked him to play a retarded Black delinquent who is attacking a young white victim in Barbes, a popular area in the north of Paris. He finally took the role as an inside experience, and his frustration got even bigger as much as most of the production movies were mostly proposing him black thug roles.

To avoid “being anyone’s muppet” and spread his own narrative of the suburbs, he finally decided to go behind the camera. With the support of “1000 visages”, he directed his first short-movie __*[Utopia](https://vimeo.com/68600058)*__, telling the struggle of a young black man - played by himself - from the suburbs who aspires to bootstrap.

In 2015, Djigui got into __[La Résidence](http://www.femis.fr/programme-la-residence-489)__, an unprecedented affirmative action program from the very elitist Parisian cinema school, __[La Femis](http://www.femis.fr/)__. This highly selective program, whose political impact is to bring to the European cinema some true outsiders’ perspectives, gives infrastructure, training courses and network to empower four young talents from the most underprivileged areas to evolve professionally within the cinema industry. At the end of the season, each trainee has to direct a short-movie project.

With La Résidence, Djigui directed __*[Na tout pour elle ](https://www.facebook.com/FrontiereDesCouleurs/)*__, a 19-minute short-movie in which he plays the main role. This is the story of Ikki, a young French-Malian Thai boxer from Grigny, who is trying to find money to help her mother going back to her original Mali. In watching his movie, I could feel some values of sacrifice, family, and this strong willingness to fight against determinism. The movie has been bought by European TV channels TV5 and RTBF and curated in several French movies festival.

On his acting career, Djigui recently got a minor role at __*[The Young Karl Marx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz-1BLjQlHo)*__, directed by Raoul Peck, the Haitian filmmaker and producer behind the excellent Oscar-nominated documentary __*[I am not your Negro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNUYdgIyaPM)*__.

To me, Djigui’s most impressive achievement remains the friendship he managed to build with Jonas, his producer who was also studying at La Femis. Jonas is a friend I met at Sciences Po University. He is the typical brilliant snobbish and sarcastic elitist Parisian Jewish, who has never experienced to urban projects before producing Djigui’s movie in Grigny. After few weeks of preparation, filming, post-production, Jonas admitted this was the most meaningful experience he had in his life. His perception of the underprivileged suburbs got more accurate and he definitely wants to keep working with Djigui. Since I strongly believe in people like Jonas to become part of tomorrow’s influential cinema decision-makers, this true social mixity and multi-ethnic bromance makes me optimistic for Djigui’s career and the causes he aspires to advocate in his work.

When he talks about his time at La Femis, Djigui says “I was welcome very well, but I don’t forget why I’m here for”. One of his upcoming main projects is a movie on a French urban projects’ _dead angle_: racism between the arabic and black communities. This is a very ambitious and complex project that will take a lot of time and energy. But again, Djigui will fight, in his mission to work on bringing fresh perspectives of the French _banlieues_, with convictions and dignity, and without hate neither taboos.
