# Championing the world’s most vulnerable ones.
 
 
Four years ago, my organization __Noise la Ville__ invited a panel of four speakers at Sciences Po __[to debate on the gipsy communities’ heritage and current situation(s) in Europe](http://www.noise-laville.fr/2013/11/20/conference-peut-on-sauver-lheritage-tzigane/)__. There were three gipsy men, including Django Reinhardt’s grandson, but also this very young bright blond juvenile-lead with a very strong posh accent from the western Parisian bourgeoisie. At the beginning of the debate, I could already see a strong contrast amongst the speakers. While the three other panelists were still impressed by Sciences Po’s elitist context and the amphitheater, the young man was totally at ease. Few seconds after arriving on the panelists’ chair, he mechanically put the his last book on the panelist table to optimize their visibility. This guy is Louis de Gouyon Matignon, one of the craziest political activists I have ever met, who has been championing of one the most despised communities in Europe.

The best way to create strong intercultural bridges with “others” remains learning their language.s. In this regard, whether we love or hate him, Louis de Gouyon Matignon has remarkably earned the Gipsy communities’ true consideration and become their main voice in the public debate. Louis is from the XVIth district of Paris, one the French poshest urban areas. As a French Marquess’ grandson, his social condition was supposed to keep his personal journey far away from the Gipsy communities. But the internet and music, certainly the world’s most effective soft-power channel, changed the narrative. When he was still a high school student, Louis discovered on Youtube gipsy jazz and their main ambassador Django Reinhardt. Quite impressed, he started playing his first guitar chords. He trained himself few days before going to some Gipsy bars and festival. His first contacts with the Gipsy communities happened with his guitar. The connection was brutal and deep, and Louis totally felt in love with this community of outcasts. He started hanging out with his new friends, getting along with their leaders, and unavoidably challenging his initial prejudices towards these people.

When he was 20, Louis decided to go on a mission: changing perceptions of the Gipsy communities in Europe. During his law studies at the Sorbonne university, he decided to create an association to defend travellers’ rights.

Few months later, he wrote his first book, a Gipsy dictionary. Most of the Parisian media, both progressive and conservative, were crazy about this incredible story. When most of the journalists were expecting to find a modern Don Quichotte, they found a convinced and well-documented evangelist with a very clear message.

In 2014, Arte, the French-German cultural channel, broadcasted a documentary, __[GADJO - Un prince chez les Manouches”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dRVaJLvQ7Y)__, that followed him between his different projects. In 2014, he created his own political organization, __[The European Party](http://partieuropeen.com/)__, to compete at the European parliament elections. One of their main measures is  the travelers’ rights within the European Union.

With more than 5 years of public activism, Louis is still a romantic political UFO. In 2015, out of nowhere, he became Gnangbo Kacou’s campaign director at the Ivory Coast presidential election.

In 2016, he spent few months in North Korea as an exchange student before being repatriated by the French government.

After writing on the Gipsy Communities, Louis recently published a book to defend the Basque Country cause.

At a very young age, Louis decided to serve and protect the marginalized, the misunderstood, the most vulnerable communities, the societies’ “blind spots”. Beyond the people and the cause he defends, what I like in Louis is that he doesn’t let anyone indifferent. He could be seen as one of the “Y-Generation” flagships, who grew up with the internet and all their main components : radical horizontality, complete transparency and border-free mindset. At his NYU’s commencement speech on May 2017, Pharrell Williams recently told young leaders “don’t be anonymous no more, inspire people”. I’m sure Louis would be delighted to translate this sentence into the Gipsy language.
