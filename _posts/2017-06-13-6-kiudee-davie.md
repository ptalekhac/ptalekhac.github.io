# Magnifying the Hip-Hop dances movement in Europe.
 
At the information age, social media become these unavoidable platforms where influential leaders can gather followers around causes and interests with regular content and radical positions. Pics on Instragram, short videos on Facebook, tutorials on Youtube, podcasts on Soundcloud, blog posts on Medium… Far from the Kardashian millions USD deals, Kiudee, a young Paris region’s high school student, started her own blog, [STRITER](https://thestriter.com/) (a mix of Street and Writer) on November 2011. Over the last five years, Kiudee has builded the most read Hip-Hop dances media in Europe. Knowing that she’s managing her blog only during her free time, STRITER’s figures are impressive : 187K annual readers in 140 countries around the world (mostly Europe, US and Japan), 25K followers on Facebook, average 22K views on her videos and 130 Hip-Hop dance events covered each year. With only her smartphone, her digital pen and an undeniable passion. #wow

_“I came to blogging by accident”_. At my association __[Noise la Ville's forum](http://www.noise-laville.fr/tech-quartiers)__ on the impact of digital transformation in the French urban projects in March 2017, she confessed that she had to some personal projects for school, and so she started writing a dance battle report for _Likethismoove.com_, a Belgium website on Hip-Hop dances. She was 16, and she really enjoyed the exercice, but she quickly felt the need for emancipation and freedom. She wanted to post whatever and whenever she wants. SRITER was born. At this time she didn’t realize that she was responding to __[a need to describe and write about the Hip-Hop dances culture](https://thestriter.com/le-probleme/)__. #kudos

Kiudee defines STRITER as _“the inside voice from the outside”_. When she’s frequently invited to cover Hip-Hop dance events all around Europe, she always places herself in the perfect position, between the shadow and the spotlight her smartphone is producing. Offline Kiudee is always smiling, but very quiet. Still, when it comes to share her thoughts, she’s definitely not afraid to openly express what she thinks and create heated debates and splits. The blog format was perfectly suited to her personality, skills and passion. In terms of inspirations, Kiudee praises some pioneering journalists like Sheyen Gamboa, but she never considered herself as a media editor. Her editorial line is herself, and she considers her writing styles close to slam. This format enables her to dig more than just covering the daily news and reports. By writing some columns on __[sexism](https://thestriter.com/f8-pourquoi-le-romantisme-hip-hop-fait-male/)__ and __[oligarchy](https://thestriter.com/lettreouverte-mafia/)__ (she termed this “the mafia”) within the Hip-Hop dance scene, she makes STRITER a platform to think about the Hip-Hop dance community that becomes her community too. #damn

When we asked her about STRITER’s business model, and the opportunities to live from her passion, Kiudee explicitly told us “After five years in the European Hip Hop dance scene, I do know where and how the money goes. That being said, I don’t want to make my blog a business.”After recently graduating from university, she’s now working as a Community Manager for various brands, and sometimes on event management missions. With the skills she has been learning over the last five years, she found her personal business model. This enables her  to remain herself on STRITER “This is me who thinks and writes down. And this is how I build my own brand and retain my own community.” Her voice is becoming more and more powerful, with a strong impact on the whole European Hip-Hop dance ecosystem : events, organizers, dancers, the audience… To her, her independence and cultural power are worth all the world’s most lucrative ad banners. #preach

Recently, she shared this following message _“You need three types of persons in your life : the visionaries, the passionates and grafetul ones.”_  After observing what she has been achieving over the last five years for the Hip-Hop dances movement in Europe, I would say Kiudee belongs into these three categories at the same time. For almost six years now, she has brought exposure and dignity to passionate dancers, whose art is still hardly recognized by our cultural public institutions. At some point, Kiudee has become the European minister of the Hip Hop dances community. #swag
