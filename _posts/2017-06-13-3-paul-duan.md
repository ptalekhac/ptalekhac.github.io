# May responsible tech strike back. 
 
 
When I saw Paul on the Society Magazine cover in the beginning of December of 2015, this was a long time I didn’t feel so much overwhelmingly proud to be French-Asian. This was two-three weeks after the Daesh terrorist attacks that deeply traumatized my life of privileged Parisian. After seventy years of uninterrupted peace in their territory, our French society was shaking, or at least questioning a lot about themselves, and more and more divided. Everyone around my various social circles had their different point of views and analysises: islam, postcolonial immigration, capitalism, unemployment, importation of the Israel-Palestine conflicts, social inequities… And then the Society Magazine cover was headlining “This little genius can beat unemployment in France.” before ending up their editorial note “What if the future of our country was not necessarily so tragic?”. When some are predicting a clash of civilizations or other civil wars inside my country, would the social peace superhero be a 25-year old French-Chinese kid?

Before the cover, I have been known Paul for few months. Like many people in the Parisian innovative ecosystem, I discovered him after his striking talk at the __[L'Echappée Volée](http://www.lechappeevolee.com/)__, a collective reflexion organized by the Tedx Paris crew on June 2015. In a 10-minute speech, Paul was telling us how come his personal story led him to create and run __[Bayes Impact](https://www.bayesimpact.org/)__, a tech non-profit organization using Big Data to improve public services, with software and algorithms as game-changers. A lot of Parisian media took over the subject, so surprised and excited to see this “exotic” French guy from the west banlieue of Trappes becoming successful in the Silicon Valley, firstly as a successful data scientist at billion-dollar valuation startup EventBrite, before optimizing US health and penitentiary services with Bayes Impact.

The buzz was tremendous in Paris, and many people wanted to help him saving the world, at least taking part in his adventure. At Officaire, the socially-normed coworking space I’ve been spending most of my time elaborating my various projects, Paul was organizing some improvised brainstorming meetups to hack the French institutions. With one of Bayes Impact’s biggest fails with the Californian ambulance services, Paul and his team learnt that the required technical skills, even led by the world’s most brilliant brains ever, were far from being sufficient to crack their project. What he called the “political engineering” was at least 50% of the job, mapping organizational charts to break-down their institutional target and elaborate various strategies on each . At the end of the day, I remembered that before studying Mathematics and Economics at UC Berkeley, Paul also graduated from the same school of mine, Sciences Po.

After months of fundraising meetings and public institutions’ lobbying, in which Paul found various supports such as French humorist Jamel Debbouze, Bayes Impact managed to sign a partnership with Pôle Emploi, the French employment agency that is willing to share their data. With this new project on the pipeline, Paul had to go back home after five years in California. In between, Bayes Impact’s Parisian office has been growing fast like a startup. On November 2016, one year after Paul’s Society Magazine cover, Bayes Impact and Pôle Emploi announced the launching of __[Bob Emploi](https://www.bob-emploi.fr/)__, a mobile app and web platform to optimize your employment search.

As a music artist doing PR promoting their album, Paul is everywhere: radio, TV, blogs… Before an apparent shyness, he’s getting use to the media exercice.

This is noticeable because in general Asian people in the Western world are not showing off. By and large, their risk-adverse confucianist culture, that values more the consensus than frontal interactions, tends to make them invisible in the public sphere, especially in the politics, media and culture. Paul and I are still influenced by this prudent mindset when it comes to manage public relations, but the more we lead to advocate our respective causes, the more we are forcing ourselves to open up and go public.

I had the chance to observe Paul during his French come-back. He is a brilliant fast-learner, a quick-thinker and resourceful hard-worker with strong ambitions for the general interest. He recently told me that his unemployment mission in France was way more difficult than he expected, raising few doubts but optimism on track. From a more optimistic perspective, I would say that in less than two years, he has gradually accepted that he’s becoming a public influential leader from the civil society who inspires many people around us. I think of our generation that is more and more prone to use our brain capital for the public good. And sometimes, inspirational vibes are too powerful that they don’t need to be quantified with data analysis. They are just here to evangelize you with a game-changing message, as Paul’s Society Magazine Cover Page did to me on December 2015.
